Update the Aditi Avenues website with a secure, visible admin login, a modernized front end using a premium white, red, grey, and gold palette, and robust backend connections. Ensure all design and backend changes enhance security, accessibility, and user experience.

1. Admin Login Button Integration
Placement:

Add an "Admin Login" button to the top navigation (header), positioned at the far right for both desktop and mobile.

Styling:

Use a gold accent for the button background or border.

Add a lock icon next to the text.

On hover, apply a subtle shadow or color change.

Functionality:

Clicking the button opens a secure login page or modal.

Use HTTPS and secure authentication (e.g., AWS Cognito).

After login, redirect to the admin dashboard.

2. Front-End Revamp: Modern, Visually Engaging Design
Color Palette
Replace all blue accents with a premium red.

Use white, red (primary accent), grey, and gold for a sophisticated look.

Apply red to CTAs, highlights, and interactive elements; gold for accents and the admin login button.

Typography
Use clean, modern sans-serif fonts for headings and body text.

Employ larger, bolder headings for key sections.

Imagery and Visuals
Use high-resolution images for banners, projects, and gallery.

Add overlays or parallax scrolling effects in hero and featured sections.

Interactive Elements
Style buttons with rounded corners, soft shadows, and hover animations.

Add fade-in, slide, or zoom effects to sections as they enter the viewport.

Use animated icons for amenities and feature lists.

Apply parallax scrolling to hero and major sections.

Layout and User Experience
Use card-based layouts for projects, amenities, gallery, and testimonials.

Cards should have drop shadows, hover effects, and responsive sizing.

Implement a sticky header and smooth scrolling for navigation.

Enable lightbox viewing and filtering in the gallery.

Add a visually distinct footer with quick links, social icons, and a newsletter signup.

Responsive Design
Ensure all pages are fully responsive for mobile, tablet, and desktop.

Use collapsible menus and touch-friendly elements for mobile users.

3. Backend Robustness & Security Enhancements
API and Data Connections
Connect all frontend forms and displays to secure, RESTful API endpoints.

Validate all incoming data on the server side.

Use HTTPS for all API communications.

Authentication & Authorization
Use AWS Cognito for secure admin authentication.

Implement role-based access control for admin features.

Store passwords securely and enable multi-factor authentication if possible.

File and Document Management
Store images and documents in Amazon S3 with access controls.

Use signed URLs for secure, temporary file access.

Validate file types and sizes during upload.

Database and Performance
Use Amazon RDS (PostgreSQL or MySQL) for structured data; enable regular backups.

Normalize tables for projects, amenities, gallery, testimonials, and users.

Use caching (e.g., Redis) for frequently accessed data.

Monitoring, Logging, and Auditing
Enable CloudWatch for monitoring and alerts.

Log all admin actions for audit trails.

Set up automated backups and disaster recovery.

Security Best Practices
Enforce HTTPS sitewide.

Sanitize inputs and encode outputs to prevent XSS and CSRF.

Use IAM roles with least-privilege permissions for AWS resources.

4. Accessibility and User Experience
Ensure all buttons and links are keyboard accessible.

Provide alt text for all images and icons.

Use sufficient color contrast with the new red accent.

Test all interactive elements for screen reader compatibility.
